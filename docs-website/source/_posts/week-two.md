On May 31th 2021 the the second week of the UK Crowd Forecasting Challenge ended. Here are this week's predictions. 

## Predictions of Covid-19 infections
Last week has seen a small spike in cases and new variants like the B.1.617 strains (the 'Indian variant') as well as the gradual easing of government restritions mean there is a risk of further rising case numbers. Participants in the UK Crowd Forecasting Challenge took this rise seriously and on average predicted a further increase over the next four weeks until June 26th 2021. Even a very large increase is within the range of what forecasters on average expect might happen. 

Here is a visualisation of the combined prediction of weekly case numbers that show the central estimate and 50% and 90% prediction intervals (the 50% and 90% prediction intervals are the ranges of values of which forecasters believe they will cover the true observed value with 50% and 90% probability)

The average crowd forecast is close to the average forecast of all model based predictions submitted to the [European Forecast Hub](https://covid19forecasthub.eu/) by various research groups, even though the crowd prediction is a bit more pessimistic. 

This is the Forecast Hub ensemble prediction:

The crowd prediction shown here is of course an average that doesn't show the full range of different predictions. You can see all individual forecasts [here](https://epiforecasts.io/uk-challenge). Most forecasters predicted a rise in reported infections, some believed the number of infections would stay flat, and only a minority predicted infections would fall. 

## Predictions of deaths from Covid-19

On average, participants predicted a slight rise in deaths resulting from Covid-19, albeit less steep than the rise in cases. This suggests that confidence in the efficacy of vaccines (how well they work) against severe disease is high - even with new variants of concern spreading.
